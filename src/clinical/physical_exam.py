Physical Exam Signs Assessment for Pediatric Critical Illness

Implements validated physical examination findings for early detection
of critical illness in pediatric SIRS patients.

Based on BMC Emergency Medicine study findings:
- Altered mental status: Sensitivity 54%, Specificity 84%
- Peripheral pulse quality: Sensitivity 8%, Specificity 98%
- Capillary refill >2s: Sensitivity 23%, Specificity 91%
- Cold/mottled extremities: Sensitivity 15%, Specificity 95%

Key finding: >=2 signs present = Relative Risk 4.98 for organ dysfunction

  early detection of critical illness in pediatric SIRS"
